     * (Body-Y) during take-off, and finally rolls (Body-X) in the air. The
     * resulting orientation of Body 3-2-1 sequence (around the capitalized axis
     * in the illustration of Taitâ€“Bryan angles) is equivalent to that of lab
     * 1-2-3 sequence (around the lower-cased axis), where the airplane is
     * rolled first (lab-x axis), and then nosed up around the horizontal lab-y
     * axis, and finally rotated around the vertical lab-z axis:
